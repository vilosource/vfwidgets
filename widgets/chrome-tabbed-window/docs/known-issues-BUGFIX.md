# ChromeTabbedWindow - Known Issues and Fixes

## Document Purpose
This document tracks known issues discovered during development and testing of ChromeTabbedWindow, including their root causes, fixes applied, and future considerations.

## Issue History

### 1. Tab Closing Synchronization Bug (FIXED)
**Date Discovered**: 2024-09-28
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: FIXED (commits dc838f4, 9886e26)

#### Problem Description
When clicking tab close buttons, especially rapidly:
- Tab content would disappear from the content area
- Tab itself remained visible in the tab bar
- Qt's `tabAt()` returned stale indices after tab removal
- Example: After removing tab at index 1, `tabAt()` would still return index 1 even though only index 0 existed

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Qt Layout Timing**: Qt defers layout updates after tab removal, causing `tabAt()` and `tabRect()` to return stale values
2. **Animation System Issues**: The TabAnimator class was attempting to animate tab removal but:
   - Signal connections were being created multiple times (memory leak)
   - Animation completion wasn't guaranteed
   - The actual `QTabBar.removeTab()` call was deferred until animation finished
   - No fallback if animation failed

#### Fix Applied
1. **Immediate Fix**: Added double validation in `ChromeTabBar.mousePressEvent()`:
   ```python
   index = self.tabAt(event.pos())
   if index >= 0:
       # CRITICAL: Check if the index is actually valid BEFORE using it
       if index >= self.count():
           # Qt returned an invalid index - treat as empty area click
           event.ignore()
           return
   ```

2. **Event Filter Fix**: Enhanced validation in `ChromeTabbedWindow.eventFilter()`:
   ```python
   is_valid_tab = (tab_index >= 0 and tab_index < self._tab_bar.count())
   ```

3. **Animation Removal**: Completely removed the broken TabAnimator system:
   - Removed TabAnimator import and instantiation
   - Simplified `_on_tab_removed()` to directly call `removeTab()`
   - Removed all animation-related code (hover, insertion, reordering)

#### Testing Performed
- Created multiple test files to reproduce the issue
- Tested rapid clicking on close buttons
- Verified both frameless and windowed modes work correctly
- Confirmed tab bar count matches widget count after removal

#### Future Considerations
If animations are to be re-implemented:
1. Connect signals only once during initialization
2. Ensure animation completion with proper timeout handling
3. Always have immediate fallback if animation fails
4. Test thoroughly with rapid user interactions
5. Consider using Qt's built-in animation framework more carefully

### 2. Window Dragging in Frameless Mode (FIXED)
**Date Discovered**: 2024-09-28
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: FIXED (commit 66a0681)

#### Problem Description
- Clicking on tabs in frameless mode would trigger window dragging instead of tab selection
- Event filter was intercepting all clicks on the tab bar

#### Fix Applied
- Modified event filter to only handle clicks on empty tab bar areas
- Properly validate tab indices before processing events

---

### 3. Tab Width Compression (WORKING)
**Date Discovered**: 2024-09-28
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Working as designed

#### Description
- Tabs compress to minimum width (52px) when many tabs are added
- Maximum width is 240px (matching Chrome behavior)
- All tabs remain visible without scrolling

#### Notes
This is intentional Chrome-like behavior and working correctly.

## Testing Recommendations

### For Tab Closing
1. Test rapid clicking on close buttons
2. Test closing tabs in different positions (first, middle, last)
3. Test with both single and multiple tabs
4. Test in both windowed and frameless modes
5. Verify tab bar count always matches content widget count

### For Event Handling
1. Test that clicking on tabs selects them (not drag window)
2. Test that clicking on empty tab bar area drags window (frameless only)
3. Test that close buttons work independently of tab selection

### For Future Animation Implementation
1. Create comprehensive test suite for animation edge cases
2. Test with rapid user interactions
3. Ensure synchronization between model, view, and animations
4. Implement proper cleanup and signal management

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Features
1. Always validate Qt-provided indices before use
2. Be aware of Qt's deferred layout updates
3. Test rapid user interactions thoroughly
4. Keep model and view synchronized
5. Prefer simple, working solutions over complex animations initially

### Signal/Slot Best Practices
1. Connect signals once during initialization
2. Disconnect signals during cleanup
3. Avoid connecting in frequently-called methods
4. Use unique connections where appropriate
