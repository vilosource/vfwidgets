# VFWidgets Markdown Widget - START HERE

**Status**: 🎯 Ready to Build - Fresh Start
**Date**: 2025-01-11

---

## What Happened

We **started completely fresh** with a clean MVC architecture.

### Old Widget Archived

The previous implementation is preserved at:
```
/home/kuja/GitHub/vfwidgets/widgets/markdown_widget_OLD_2025-01-11/
```

You can reference it but we're not using it (except we'll copy the working MarkdownViewer later).

### Fresh Start

We now have a clean slate with proper architecture designed from the start.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Read the Architecture (5 min)

```bash
cat docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
```

**Key concepts**:
- Model = Pure Python, no Qt
- Views = Qt widgets that observe model
- Controller = Coordinates operations
- Observer pattern = Automatic synchronization

### 2. Review the Tasks (5 min)

```bash
cat docs/TASKS.md
```

**What you'll see**:
- 20 tasks total (15 core + 5 demos)
- 4 phases (Model → Views → Controllers → Integration)
- 2-3 days estimated
- Every task has validation commands

### 3. Start Building (Now!)

```bash
# Begin with TASK-001
cd /home/kuja/GitHub/vfwidgets/widgets/markdown_widget

# Follow docs/TASKS.md sequentially
# Mark tasks as complete with ✅
# Run validation commands
# Show evidence that each works
```

## The Plan

### Phase 1: Model Layer (4 hours)
Build pure Python document model:
- ✅ Task-001: Create model files
- ✅ Task-002: Core document operations
- ✅ Task-003: Observer pattern
- ✅ Task-004: TOC parsing
- ✅ Task-005: Model tests
- ✅ Demo-1: Model foundation demo

**Milestone**: Can create, modify, observe document WITHOUT Qt

### Phase 2: View Layer (3 hours)
Build Qt views that observe model:
- ✅ Task-101: MarkdownTextEditor
- ✅ Task-102: MarkdownTocView
- ✅ Task-103: View tests
- ✅ Demo-2: Multiple views demo

**Milestone**: Multiple views of same document work

### Phase 3: Controller Layer (2 hours)
Build coordinators:
- ✅ Task-201: MarkdownEditorController
- ✅ Task-202: Controller tests
- ✅ Demo-3: Controller features demo

**Milestone**: Can pause/resume rendering, throttle updates

### Phase 4: Integration (3 hours)
Bring it all together:
- ✅ Task-301: Package setup (pyproject.toml)
- ✅ Task-302: Composite widget (MarkdownEditorWidget)
- ✅ Task-303: README
- ✅ Task-304: Copy MarkdownViewer from old widget
- ✅ Task-305: Integration tests
- ✅ Demo-4: Complete editor demo
- ✅ Demo-5: AI streaming demo

**Milestone**: Production-ready widget!

## Key Architectural Insight: Dual Pattern Approach

**We use BOTH Python observer pattern AND Qt signals/slots strategically:**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Model (Pure Python) → Observer Pattern    │
│  ↓                                         │
│  Views (Qt Widgets) → Qt Signals/Slots     │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why two patterns?**
- **Model → Views**: Python observer (keeps model pure Python, testable without Qt)
- **View ↔ View**: Qt signals/slots (native Qt, best for UI coordination)
- **Best of both worlds!**

See ARCHITECTURE.md "Qt Signals vs Observer Pattern" section for full details.

## Key Documents

### 📘 ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Why**: Understand the MVC design + dual pattern approach
- **What**: Layer breakdown, patterns, Qt signals vs observers, examples
- **When**: Read before starting tasks

### 📋 TASKS.md
- **Why**: Know what to build
- **What**: Sequential tasks with validation
- **When**: Execute tasks in order

### 🎯 This File (START-HERE.md)
- **Why**: Quick orientation
- **What**: Overview and quick start
- **When**: You just read it!

## Principles

### ✅ DO

1. **Follow tasks sequentially** - Each builds on previous
2. **Validate everything** - Run validation commands
3. **Show evidence** - Paste output proving it works
4. **Keep model pure** - No Qt in models/
5. **Use observer pattern** - Views observe model
6. **Write tests** - Every component tested

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Skip ahead** - Tasks have dependencies
2. **Assume it works** - Always validate
3. **Put Qt in model** - Keep it pure Python
4. **Manually sync views** - Use observer pattern
5. **Skip tests** - We're doing this right
6. **Look at old code** - Start fresh (except MarkdownViewer)

---

## Quick Commands

### Check Current Structure
```bash
tree -L 3
```

### Run Tests
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Test Model Import
```bash
python -c "from vfwidgets_markdown.models import MarkdownDocument"
```

### Run Demo
```bash
python examples/demo_model_foundation.py
```

---

## When You Get Stuck

### 1. Review Architecture
```bash
cat docs/ARCHITECTURE.md | less
```

### 2. Check Task Details
```bash
cat docs/TASKS.md | less
```

### 3. Look at Old Widget (Reference Only)
```bash
cd ../markdown_widget_OLD_2025-01-11
# Look at code for reference
# But DON'T copy/paste (except MarkdownViewer)
cd ../markdown_widget
```

### 4. Run Tests
```bash
pytest tests/ -v -s
```

---

## Success Looks Like

After completing all tasks:

```bash
# Model works without Qt
python -c "from vfwidgets_markdown.models import MarkdownDocument; doc = MarkdownDocument('test'); print(doc.get_text())"
# Output: test

# Views observe model
python examples/demo_multiple_views.py
# Output: Window with synced views

# Complete editor works
python examples/demo_complete_editor.py
# Output: Full-featured markdown editor

# AI streaming works
python examples/demo_ai_streaming.py
# Output: Smooth streaming demonstration

# All tests pass
pytest tests/ -v
# Output: All green
```

---

## Timeline

**Optimistic**: 2 days (if you know the patterns)
**Realistic**: 3 days (learning + building)
**With breaks**: 1 week (few hours per day)

**Don't rush** - Do it right!

---

## What's Next After This?

Once the MVC foundation is solid:

1. **AI Streaming Features** - Advanced streaming APIs
2. **Theme Integration** - vfwidgets-theme support
3. **More Widgets** - MarkdownViewerWidget, toolbars
4. **Export Features** - PDF, HTML export
5. **Plugins** - Extension system

But first: **Build the foundation right!**

---

## Ready?

1. ✅ Read ARCHITECTURE.md
2. ✅ Open TASKS.md
3. ✅ Start with TASK-001
4. ✅ Execute sequentially
5. ✅ Validate each task
6. ✅ Build something great!

**Go build! 🚀**
