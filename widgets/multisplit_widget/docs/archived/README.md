# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation from the development of MultisplitWidget. These documents capture the design process, implementation plans, and architectural decisions but are **not needed for using MultisplitWidget**.

For current documentation, see the [main docs directory](../).

## What's Here

### Superseded Documentation

These files have been consolidated into the current documentation:

- **api-best-practices-GUIDE.md** → Consolidated into [GUIDE.md](../GUIDE.md)
- **api-stability-GUIDE.md** → Consolidated into [MIGRATION.md](../MIGRATION.md)
- **migration-guide-GUIDE.md** → Consolidated into [MIGRATION.md](../MIGRATION.md)
- **api.md** → Replaced by [API.md](../API.md)
- **usage.md** → Replaced by [QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md) and [GUIDE.md](../GUIDE.md)

### Implementation History

- **api-improvements-PLAN.md** - v0.2.0 API improvement plan (completed)
- **fixed-container-architecture-DESIGN.md** - Container architecture redesign (completed)
- **fixed-container-architecture-SUMMARY.md** - Architecture summary (completed)
- **focus-management-GUIDE.md** - Focus system guide (integrated into GUIDE.md)
- **implementation-tasks-GUIDE.md** - Phase 1 implementation tasks (completed)
- **phase1-results-REPORT.md** - Phase 1 test results (completed)

## Why Archive?

These documents served their purpose during development but created too much clutter for developers just trying to use MultisplitWidget. The essential information has been distilled into the current 4-document structure:

1. **[QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md)** - Get started in 5 minutes
2. **[API.md](../API.md)** - Complete API reference
3. **[GUIDE.md](../GUIDE.md)** - Best practices & patterns
4. **[MIGRATION.md](../MIGRATION.md)** - Version migration & stability

Plus **[README.md](../README.md)** as the index.

## Should I Read These?

**No**, unless you're:
- Contributing to MultisplitWidget core development
- Researching the design decisions and architecture
- Curious about the development process

For **using MultisplitWidget**, stick to the main documentation.
