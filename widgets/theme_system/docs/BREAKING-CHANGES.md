## Purpose

This document tracks all breaking changes introduced during the Theme Overlay System implementation (v2.0.0). It is continuously updated as implementation progresses.

**Policy**: We prioritize correctness and long-term maintainability. If the current API has design flaws, we fix them even if it requires breaking changes. Every breaking change must be documented here with migration paths.

## Appendix: Migration Checklist for External Users

When vfwidgets-theme 2.0.0 is released, external users should follow this checklist:

### Pre-Migration
- [ ] Read this BREAKING-CHANGES.md document completely
- [ ] Review the specification: [theme-overlay-system-SPECIFICATION.md](./theme-overlay-system-SPECIFICATION.md)
- [ ] Review the vision: [theme-customization-system-VISION.md](./theme-customization-system-VISION.md)
- [ ] Identify which breaking changes affect your code
- [ ] Plan migration effort based on affected components

### Migration
- [ ] Update dependency: `vfwidgets-theme >= 2.0.0`
- [ ] For each breaking change affecting your code:
  - [ ] Read the "What Breaks" section
  - [ ] Understand the "Why This Change" rationale
  - [ ] Follow the "Migration Path" instructions
  - [ ] Update your code
  - [ ] Test thoroughly

### Validation
- [ ] Run your full test suite
- [ ] Manually test theme-related functionality
- [ ] Verify theme changes propagate correctly
- [ ] Test custom theme persistence (if applicable)
- [ ] Check performance (theme switching should be <100ms)

### Reporting Issues
If you encounter migration issues:
1. Check if your issue is documented in BREAKING-CHANGES.md
2. Review the specification for clarification
3. Open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/viloforge/vfwidgets/issues
   - Include: which breaking change, what went wrong, code example
