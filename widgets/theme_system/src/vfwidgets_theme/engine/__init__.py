"""
Theme engine components.

This module contains the theme application and processing engine:
- Theme applicator: Applies themes to widgets efficiently
- QSS generator: Converts theme data to Qt stylesheets
- Property resolver: Resolves theme properties with inheritance and fallbacks

The engine is the processing layer that transforms theme data into applied styles
on widgets. It's designed for performance and correctness.
