"""Utility components.

This module contains utilities and helper functions:
- Color utilities: Color manipulation, validation, conversion
- Cache system: High-performance caching with automatic invalidation
- Pattern matching: Theme and property pattern matching utilities

Utilities provide supporting functionality but are not part of the core
business logic or user-facing API.
