## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Non-Critical

**1. Segmentation Fault on Exit**
- Harmless Qt cleanup race condition
- Does NOT affect functionality
- Does NOT cause data loss
- Only occurs when closing application
- Will be fixed in Phase 3

**2. Headless Test Failures**
- 4 tests fail without display (UI visibility checks)
- All functionality works in real GUI
- Test environment issue only

**3. RGB Validation**
- RGB format (`rgb(r,g,b)`) validation is strict
- Workaround: Use hex format instead
- Color picker outputs hex automatically

See `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` for complete list and workarounds.
