1. **Dependency Injection** - All components injected, never imported directly
2. **WeakRef Registry** - Automatic memory management, zero leaks
3. **Qt Signals/Slots** - Thread safety through Qt's event system
4. **Error Recovery** - Never crash, always fallback to minimal theme
5. **Performance First** - Every feature must meet strict performance requirements

## Success Criteria
- ThemedWidget provides simple, clean inheritance API
- ThemedApplication offers intuitive theme management
- All complexity hidden from developers
- Type-safe interfaces throughout
- Zero memory leaks after extended usage
- Sub-100ms theme switching performance
- Thread-safe operation under load
- Comprehensive error recovery
