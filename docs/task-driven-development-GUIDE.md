# Task-Driven Development Guide - VFWidgets Methodology

**Status**: üìñ Methodology Guide
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Author**: VFWidgets Team
**Purpose**: Document our task-driven development approach for replication across projects

---

## üéØ What is Task-Driven Development?

Task-Driven Development (TDD) is our methodology for implementing complex, multi-week projects while preserving architectural context and preventing drift.

**Core Idea**: Break implementation into granular, self-contained tasks where each task includes:
- Complete architectural context
- Full implementation code (copy-paste ready)
- Complete tests
- Runnable examples
- Validation checklists

**Result**: Anyone (including your future self) can implement the project correctly without participating in design discussions.

## üìã Creating the Document Set

### Step 1: Design Phase - Create Architecture Document

**File**: `{project}-architecture-DESIGN.md`

**Contents**:
1. **Core Design Principles** (Why are we doing this?)
   - List 3-5 key architectural principles
   - Explain rationale for each
   - Provide examples

2. **Complete Architecture** (What are we building?)
   - Full component hierarchy
   - Layer definitions
   - Component responsibilities
   - Interaction patterns

3. **Public API Specifications** (How will it be used?)
   - API signatures for each component
   - Signal definitions
   - Usage examples (5-6 patterns from simple to complex)

4. **Key Design Decisions** (What did we decide and why?)
   - List major decisions
   - Explain alternatives considered
   - Justify chosen approach

**Example Structure**:
```markdown

---

### Step 2: Create Implementation Rules Document

**File**: `IMPLEMENTATION-RULES.md`

**Contents**:
1. **Core Principles** (expanded from architecture)
   - Each principle gets its own section

   - Signal patterns
   - Common compositions
   - Testing patterns

3. **Common Pitfalls** (what NOT to do)
   - List 5-10 common mistakes

   - Show correct pattern code
   - Explain why it matters

4. **Implementation Checklist** (validation)
   - Checklist for each component type
   - Specific items to verify
   - Testing requirements

- [ ] [Specific check]
```

**Time Investment**: 3-4 hours

---

### Step 3: Create Task List with Complete Implementations

**File**: `{project}-implementation-TASKS.md`

**Critical**: This is where most time is spent. Each task must be **completely self-contained**.

**Task Template**:
```markdown
### TASK-XXX: [Component Name]

**‚ö†Ô∏è Before Starting - Read These Documents**:
1. `IMPLEMENTATION-RULES.md` - Sections: [list specific sections]
2. `{project}-architecture-DESIGN.md` - Section: [specific section]
3. `phase*-REFERENCE.md` - [What to look for]

**Architecture Context**:
- **Layer**: [Which layer in architecture]
- **MVC Role**: [MODEL/VIEW/CONTROLLER/etc.]
- **Responsibility**: [Single sentence - what it does]
- **Key Principle**: [Which principle from rules applies]
- **Pattern**: [Which pattern to use]
- **Why [Type]**: [Why this architectural choice]

**Design Notes**:
- [Key constraint 1 - what NOT to do]
- [Key constraint 2]
- [Implementation approach]
- [Specific behavior notes]

**Description**: [One sentence summary]

**File to Create**: `path/to/file.py`

**Public API**:
```python
# Complete API specification with types and docstrings
class Component:
    """Full docstring."""

    signal_name = Signal(type)

    def method_name(self, arg: type) -> type:
        """Docstring with Args/Returns."""
```

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# COMPLETE WORKING IMPLEMENTATION
# This is copy-paste ready code
# Include ALL methods, ALL imports, ALL logic
# 50-150 lines typically

from module import Class

class Component:
    # Full implementation here
    pass
```

**Testing**:
```python
# File: tests/path/test_component.py
# COMPLETE TEST FILE
# 5-10 test functions covering public API

import pytest

def test_creation(qapp):
    """Test component can be created."""
    pass

def test_public_method(qapp):
    """Test public method works."""
    pass
```

**Example**:
```python
# File: examples/XX_component.py
# COMPLETE RUNNABLE EXAMPLE
# Shows real usage of the component

def main():
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    demo = DemoWidget()
    demo.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec())
```

**Dependencies**: [List task IDs that must complete first]

**Expected Output**:
- File created: `path/to/file.py`
- Import works: `from package import Component`
- Tests pass: `pytest tests/path/test_component.py -v`
- Example runs: `python examples/XX_component.py`

**‚úÖ Completion Checklist ([Component Type])**:
- [ ] [Specific verification 1]
- [ ] [Specific verification 2]
- [ ] [Specific verification 3]
- [ ] Import verification passes
- [ ] All tests pass with -v flag
- [ ] Example runs without errors
- [ ] Code follows [pattern name] pattern
- [ ] [Component-specific check]

---
```

**Key Requirements for Tasks**:
1. **Complete code** - not pseudocode, actual working implementation
2. **Complete tests** - not test descriptions, actual test functions
3. **Complete examples** - not usage notes, runnable Python files
4. **Context headers** - every task reminds you of principles
5. **Checklists** - every task validates compliance

**Time Investment**: 8-12 hours (most important document)
- Budget 30-60 minutes per task
- 15-20 tasks typical
- DO NOT RUSH THIS - it saves weeks later

## üéØ When to Use This Methodology

**Good Fit**:
- ‚úÖ Multi-week projects (2+ weeks)
- ‚úÖ Complex architectures (3+ layers)
- ‚úÖ Multiple components (10+ classes)
- ‚úÖ Multiple phases (2+ distinct phases)
- ‚úÖ Risk of context loss (long projects)
- ‚úÖ Multiple developers (or solo across long time)
- ‚úÖ Critical to maintain architecture consistency

**Poor Fit**:
- ‚ùå Single-file scripts
- ‚ùå 1-day projects
- ‚ùå Exploratory prototypes
- ‚ùå Throwaway code
- ‚ùå Projects with unclear requirements

**Rule of Thumb**: If implementation will take more than 1 week, use Task-Driven Development.

---

## üîÑ Adapting to Different Project Types

### For Widget Projects (like markdown-widget)
- Focus on MVC layers
- Emphasize composability
- Include usage patterns
- Show atomic ‚Üí composite progression

### For Application Projects (like ViloxTerm)
- Focus on plugin architecture
- Emphasize extensibility points
- Include integration patterns
- Show core ‚Üí plugins progression

### For Library Projects
- Focus on public API design
- Emphasize backward compatibility
- Include migration guides
- Show simple ‚Üí advanced API usage

### For Refactoring Projects
- Document current state (as-is)
- Document target state (to-be)
- Include migration strategies
- Show step-by-step transformation

**Key**: Adapt the structure, not the methodology. Always include:
1. Architecture document (DESIGN)
2. Implementation rules (RULES)
3. Task list with complete code (TASKS)
4. Phase references (REFERENCE)
5. Navigation hub (START-HERE)

**Complexity**: 14+ components, 4 layers, 3 weeks
**Team**: 1 developer (with potential gaps)

**Approach**:
- Created 7 documentation files
- 28 hours planning
- Complete code in every task

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ Could return after 2 weeks, back on track in 20 minutes
- ‚úÖ Zero architectural drift
- ‚úÖ Consistent code patterns throughout
- ‚úÖ New developer could onboard in 1 hour
- ‚úÖ Complete implementation possible without any design discussions

**Quote**: *"Even if we forget everything about our discussions, someone can pick this up and implement it correctly."*

---

## üìö Additional Resources

### Templates
- See `widgets/markdown_widget/wip/` for complete example
- Copy structure for new projects
- Adapt to your specific needs

### Tools
- Markdown for all documentation
- ASCII art for diagrams (simple, version-control friendly)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Checklists for validation

### Best Practices
- **Be explicit**: Never assume knowledge
- **Be complete**: Include full working code
- **Be consistent**: Use same patterns throughout
- **Be validatable**: Include checklists
- **Be recoverable**: Support context loss

---

## üöÄ Getting Started with Your Next Project

### Step 1: Set Up Directory
```bash
mkdir -p project/wip
cd project/wip
```

### Step 2: Create Documents (in order)
1. Start with architecture design (4-6 hours)
2. Extract implementation rules (3-4 hours)
3. Create task list with code (8-12 hours)
4. Write phase references (2-3 hours)
5. Write START-HERE last (2-3 hours)

### Step 3: Validate
- [ ] Can someone with zero context understand what to build?
- [ ] Does each task have complete code?
- [ ] Are there templates for common patterns?
- [ ] Are anti-patterns documented?
- [ ] Is there a clear entry point?

### Step 4: Implement
- Follow your own task list
- Check completion checklists
- Update docs if you find gaps
- Celebrate small wins!

## üí° Final Thoughts

**Task-Driven Development is an investment in:**
- Architectural consistency
- Developer productivity
- Context preservation
- Project maintainability
- Knowledge transfer

**The alternative cost:**
- Architectural drift
- Inconsistent implementations
- Lost time recovering context
- Debugging architectural violations
- Knowledge silos

**Choose wisely. Your future self will thank you.** üéâ
